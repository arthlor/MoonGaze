# Firestore Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Composite Index Error**
   - Error: "The query requires an index" for linkingCodes collection
   - Missing index for: createdBy (ASC), expiresAt (ASC), __name__ (ASC)

2. **Permission Denied Error**
   - Error: "Missing or insufficient permissions" when accessing user documents
   - Root cause: Data type mismatch between stored data and Firestore rules expectations

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Firestore Index

**File:** `firestore.indexes.json`

Added the missing composite index:
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "linkingCodes",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    {
      "fieldPath": "createdBy",
      "order": "ASCENDING"
    },
    {
      "fieldPath": "expiresAt",
      "order": "ASCENDING"
    },
    {
      "fieldPath": "__name__",
      "order": "ASCENDING"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Fixed Data Type Issues in Auth Service

**File:** `src/services/authService.ts`

**Problem:** The service was storing raw JavaScript `Date` objects instead of Firestore `Timestamp` objects, causing serialization issues and permission problems.

**Changes:**
- Added imports for proper type conversion functions
- Updated `signUp()` to use `createUser()` and `userToDocument()` functions
- Updated `login()` to properly convert between document and user types
- Updated `getCurrentUser()` to use `documentToUser()` conversion
- Updated `updateUserOnboardingStatus()` to handle proper type conversion

### 3. Fixed Data Type Issues in Notification Service

**File:** `src/services/notificationService.ts`

**Problem:** The service was using raw `Date` objects when updating user documents.

**Changes:**
- Added `Timestamp` import from firebase/firestore
- Updated `saveTokenToUser()` to use `Timestamp.fromDate(new Date())`
- Updated `handleNotificationError()` to use `Timestamp.fromDate(new Date())`

### 4. Added Consistent Security Rules

**File:** `firestore.rules`

Added the missing catch-all deny rule for consistency with production rules:
```javascript
// Deny all other access
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if false;
}
```

## Deployment

The following commands were run to deploy the fixes:

```bash
# Deploy updated Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

Note: The index deployment showed that the required index already existed, which is good.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was a **data type mismatch**:

1. **Expected:** Firestore security rules expect `Timestamp` objects for date fields
2. **Actual:** Services were storing raw JavaScript `Date` objects
3. **Result:** Firestore couldn't properly serialize/deserialize the data, causing permission errors

The missing index was a secondary issue that occurred during cleanup operations.

## Testing

After applying these fixes:

1. ✅ Firestore indexes are properly configured
2. ✅ User document creation uses proper Firestore types
3. ✅ User document updates use proper Firestore types
4. ✅ Security rules are consistent between development and production
5. ✅ All services use the proper type conversion utilities

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use type conversion functions** from `src/types/index.ts`:
   - `userToDocument()` / `documentToUser()`
   - `taskToDocument()` / `documentToTask()`
   - `partnershipToDocument()` / `documentToPartnership()`
   - `linkingCodeToDocument()` / `documentToLinkingCode()`

2. **Use Firestore Timestamp** for all date fields when updating documents:
   - `Timestamp.fromDate(new Date())` for current time
   - `serverTimestamp()` for server-side timestamps

3. **Test with Firestore emulator** during development to catch type issues early

4. **Keep security rules consistent** between development and production environments
